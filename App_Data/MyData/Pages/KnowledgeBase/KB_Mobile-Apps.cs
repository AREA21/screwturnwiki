((('''summary''': There are a lot of technologies out there to help you go mobile. There are frameworks, IDEs, debuggers, emulators, ... the works! But before you pick your tools, you need to chose the type of mobile application you plan to build. There are 3 types of mobile application to choose from.)))

=== Mobile application types:===
<PRE>
==== Native Applications====
These are mobile applications that you install on your device via an appstore. Usually these apps provide a very rich 
user experience, because they are built specifically for a particular device’s hardware. On the downside, for each device 
you plan to support, you’ll need to build a specific version of your app.

==== Mobile Web Applications====
These are mobile applications that run on a web server, and are accessed via the device’s web browser using an internet 
connection. Note that these are not regular web sites, but rather purpose built mobile applications that, when done right, 
provide the same look and feel of native apps but require internet connection to execute.

==== Hybrid Applications====
The goal of this type of application is to get the advantages of both native and mobile web applications. This is achieved 
by building a very thin native shell around a mobile web application, extending the mobile web application with capabilities 
that only native applications can access. By using this technology you can put your application on the appstore, and you can 
use extended features of the phone like the camera or gyroscope. But, you’ll still need to build a specific version of this 
thin native shell for each supported device.
